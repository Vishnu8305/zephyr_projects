# Zephyr Projects â€“ ESP32S3 & STM32

This repository contains my experiments and projects using **Zephyr RTOS** with  
- **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3**, and  
- **STM32 custom boards**  

The projects include standalone examples for each board as well as collaborative setups where ESP32S3 and STM32 communicate under Zephyr.
